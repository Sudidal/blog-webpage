# react-template

My template for react apps equiped with:
* vite
* react
* eslint



### TODO:
1. message fade animation
3. add tinyMce
4. display unpublished posts
5. Something is wrong with the API, there should be a way to limit the results, currently when displaying a list of posts, we are retreiving the comments too which wont be displayed anyway + retreiving the comments along with post will make us need to re-load the hole post if the comments where changed
